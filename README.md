# ReadMePros
A collection of awesome readme files for github profiles. We are curently working on a website that will show these read me files in a nice way with options to filter, read source code, and with a link to take users directly to the github profile of the contributor.

Available categories as of now: *code-styled*, *default*, *dynamic-realtime*, *elaborate*, *multimedia*, *short-and-sweet*, *tabular*
Feel free to suggest new categories to use to filter the profiles even better.

#### How to Contribute
1. Create a pull request that adds a folder with these files:
  - config.json
  - your-name.png
  - your-name.md
2. Name of the folder can be your first name and last name concatinated.
  
`Note: Make sure you replace your-name with lowercase, concatination of your first name and last name.`
